## Live Coin Project

[Live Coin](https://live-coin.netlify.app/)

Live-Coin is a Real-Time web application which utilizes Socket.io for bidirectional 
WebSocket connection. Here you can see that the numbers and prices are changing 
repeatedly without sending additional network requests.

### Goal

The goal here is to both practice and showcase the ability for creating a web application
based on WebSocket and Socket.io technology.
